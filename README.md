Internet mapping involves scanning the entire (IPv4) internet for potential ports and services to find Cicada 3301.

WARNING: Service analysis maps (HTTP, etc) are not using compliant JSON, they're packaged as a **vector of objects**. 

All service analysis mapping was done through custom tooling to provide full service info, carefully familiarise yourself with the formatting.
